## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Jianan Chen. As a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Purdue University, my research focuses on federated learning, game theory, and privacy-preserving machine learning. My work bridges theoretical modeling and real-world applications, addressing challenges in federated unlearning, differential privacy, and decentralized optimization. My work published in premier IEEE journals and conferences. I am eager to leverage my expertise in secure and scalable AI and trustworthy machine learning.
